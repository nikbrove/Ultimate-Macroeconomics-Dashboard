"""Idempotent Postgres role provisioning + read-only grants.

Folds in the responsibility that lived in the standalone `db_init` container:
ensure the read-only LLM role exists with the current password from env, and
that it can ``SELECT`` from every existing and future public table.

Runs on every `downloader_general` startup, so rotating
``POSTGRES_LLM_PASSWORD`` in ``.env`` takes effect on the next boot without an
extra container, and a fresh deployment / upgrade re-applies the grants in case
new tables were added since the last bootstrap.

The app superuser (``POSTGRES_USER``) is created natively by the
``postgres:18`` image at first volume init and is the role we connect as
here — so it never needs upserting from this code, and ``ALTER DEFAULT
PRIVILEGES FOR ROLE <superuser>`` correctly targets the role that later
creates the World Bank + Yahoo tables.

    ``sql_uri`` must authenticate as a Postgres SUPERUSER so the role can be

    and password literals go through ``format()`` with ``%I`` / ``%L`` so SQL
    injection is impossible even though the inputs are server-controlled.

    The function is intentionally idempotent: every statement is safe to re-run
    on each container startup. ``GRANT ... ON ALL TABLES`` covers tables that
    already exist; ``ALTER DEFAULT PRIVILEGES`` covers future tables created by
